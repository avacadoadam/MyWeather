# Weather app

Your goal is to build a weather application which shows current weather conditions at user's location. The application has a bottom bar with 2 screens. 

## First screen 
The current weather conditions: temperature, pressure, humidity and wind. Also, a description of the condition and an icon representing it is shown. 

User can use pull to refresh to fetch the latest weather information. If pull to refresh fails, a snack bar message is shown with a retry option.

When a user enters the app and the API is not available or the user doesn't have internet enabled, a layout with warning message and retry option is shown.

If a user denies location permission, the app shows Zagreb as a default location with an indicator stating location is not available because permission is denied.

If a user location can not be found, the app shows an indicator with info message about it. 

## Second screen
A settings screen with 2 options 

* Unit of measurement - User can select between celsius, fahrenheit and kelvin. (default celsius). The first screen is refreshed when this option is changed.  
* Dark/Light mode switch - User can switch between dark and light mode for the first screen of the app. The screen should update accordingly.

## Other info
* The min support is Android 5.0 and the app can be locked in portrait mode. 
* The API reference can be found here https://openweathermap.org/api , but if you like, you can use any open weather API.
* The app should be compatible with Android 5.0+  devices. 
* You can use a programming language of your choice (Kotlin/Java). 
* You can use whatever third-party libs you like.
* We want to see how you think and solve problems. You can use some of the design patterns such as MVVM, MVP, Clean Architecture, but youâ€™re not required to. Maybe you have some better architecture for a specific problem?
* The UX is also interesting to us, and we expect it to be usable.
* If you need icons, you can use your own, default or download them from here: https://material.io/icons/
